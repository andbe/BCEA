## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed from the build large data files so that not more than 5 MB for a CRAN package.

* Reference about the method added in the Description.

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

* Any notes about using INLA has been condoned in previous versions, as they are only suggested.


## Downstream dependencies

We checked 2 reverse dependencies, comparing R CMD check results across CRAN and dev versions of this package.

* We saw 0 new problems
* We failed to check 0 packages
