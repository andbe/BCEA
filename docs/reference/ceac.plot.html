    <dl><dt>he</dt>
<dd><p>A <code>bcea</code> object containing the results of the Bayesian
modelling and the economic evaluation.</p></dd>


<dt>comparison</dt>
<dd><p>Selects the comparator, in case of more than two
interventions being analysed. Default as NULL plots all the comparisons
together. Any subset of the possible comparisons can be selected (e.g.,
<code>comparison=c(1,3)</code> or <code>comparison=2</code>).</p></dd>


<dt>pos</dt>
<dd><p>Parameter to set the position of the legend (only relevant for
multiple interventions, ie more than 2 interventions being compared).
Can be given in form
of a string <code>(bottom|top)(right|left)</code> for base graphics and
<code>bottom|top|left|right</code> for ggplot2. It can be a two-elements vector,
which specifies the relative position on the x and y axis respectively, or
alternatively it can be in form of a logical variable, with <code>FALSE</code>
indicating to use the default position and <code>TRUE</code> to place it on the
bottom of the plot.</p></dd>


<dt>graph</dt>
<dd><p>A string used to select the graphical engine to use for
plotting. Should (partial-)match the three options <code>"base"</code>,
<code>"ggplot2"</code> or <code>"plotly"</code>. Default value is <code>"base"</code>.
Not all plotting functions have a <code>"plotly"</code> implementation yet.</p></dd>


<dt>...</dt>
<dd><p>If <code>graph = "ggplot2"</code> and a named theme object is supplied,
it will be passed to the ggplot2 object. The usual ggplot2 syntax is used.
Additional arguments:</p><ul><li><p><code>line = list(color)</code>: specifies the line colour(s) - all graph types.</p></li>
<li><p><code>line = list(type)</code>: specifies the line type(s) as <code>lty</code> numeric values - all graph types.</p></li>
<li><p><code>line = list(size)</code>: specifies the line width(s) as numeric values - all graph types.</p></li>
<li><p><code>currency</code>: Currency prefix to willingness to pay values - ggplot2 only.</p></li>
<li><p><code>area_include</code>: logical, include area under the CEAC curves - plotly only.</p></li>
<li><p><code>area_color</code>: specifies the AUC colour - plotly only.</p></li>
</ul></dd>

<dd><p>If <code>graph = "ggplot2"</code> a ggplot object, or if <code>graph = "plotly"</code>
a plotly object containing the requested plot. Nothing is returned when <code>graph = "base"</code>,
the default.</p></dd>
</dl><p>The function produces a plot of the
cost-effectiveness acceptability curve against the discrete grid of possible
values for the willingness to pay parameter. Values of the CEAC closer to 1
indicate that uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness of the reference
intervention is very low. Similarly, values of the CEAC closer to 0 indicate
that uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness of the comparator is very low.</p>

    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="details">Details<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#details"></a></h2>
    <p>The CEAC estimates the probability of cost-effectiveness, with respect to a
given willingness to pay threshold. The CEAC is used mainly to evaluate the
uncertainty associated with the decision-making process, since it enables the
quantification of the preference of the compared interventions, defined in terms
of difference in utilities.
Formally, the CEAC is defined as:</p>
<p>$$\textrm{CEAC} = P(\textrm{IB}(\theta) &gt; 0)$$</p>
<p>If the net benefit function is used as utility function, the definition can be
re-written as</p>
<p>$$\textrm{CEAC} = P(k \cdot \Delta_e - \Delta_c &gt; 0)$$</p>
<p>effectively depending on the willingness to pay value \(k\).</p>
